# Node.js

## Introduction

Node. js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node. js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Here is a more simple way of what node.js is:

`
    Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library
`

### Features of Node.js
The following are some of the important features that make Node.js the first choice of software architects.

- **Asynchronous and Event Driven** - All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.
- **Very Fast** - Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.
- **Single Threaded but Highly Scalable** - Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.
- **No Buffering** - Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
- **License** - Node.js is released under the MIT license[<img src="https://www.pngfind.com/pngs/m/88-882006_shares-svg-png-icon-shares-icon-transparent-png.png" height="10px" width="10px" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joyent/node/v0.12.0/LICENSE).

### Where Should I use Node.js?
The following are the areas where Node.js is proving itself as a perfect technology partner.

- I/O bound Applications
- Data Streaming Applications
- Data Intensive Real-time Applications (DIRT)
- JSON APIs based Applications
- Single Page Applications

### Is there a place that I cannot use or not reccomended to use node.js?
It is not advisable to use Node.js for CPU intensive applications.
